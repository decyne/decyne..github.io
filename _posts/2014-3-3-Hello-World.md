Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

* Easily layer a hex grid over any map
* Adjustable hex sizes
* Able to make hex grid transparent
* Automatically key hexes
* Clicking on hex/hex key links you to the section describing the pdf
